# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to use the avilable dataset and predict credit risk with machine learning techniques. Several machine learning models are used to predict credit risk using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. 

Credit risk is considered to be an unbalanced classification problem because good loans outnumber the risky loans. In this analysis, differenet techniques are used to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. 

Imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries are used to build and evaluate models using resampling. Data was oversampled using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. SMOTEENN algorithm was used for a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling.

Two macine learing models, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier are used to compare and to predict credit risks.The performance of these models were evaluated and a recommendation was provided on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
